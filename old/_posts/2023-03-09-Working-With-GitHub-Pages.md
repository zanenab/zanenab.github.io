## Certified Bozo

I have finished some of the training I was working on for the CompTIA Security+ exam. I now find myself in posesion of more free time than I know what to do with. I have decided to build a website for my self. The first step is GH Pages. Then I'll move the Google Cloud Compute. I have some credits, so I assume I can run a website for some duration of time.
